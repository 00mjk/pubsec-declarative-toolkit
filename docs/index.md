GCP Canadian PubSec Sandbox
===========================

What is this Sandbox?
---------------------

The GCP Canadian PubSec Sandbox is an opionated way for Canadian Public Sector customers to standup a compliant Google Cloud environment that meets the 30 day Canadian Cloud Guardrails [https://github.com/canada-ca/cloud-guardrails-gcp](https://github.com/canada-ca/cloud-guardrails-gcp) in order to experiment with Google Cloud Platform solutions.

What problem does the Sandbox solve?
------------------------------------

It's difficult to know all products and solutions built on / in Google Cloud Platform. The Sandbox allows you to deploy a pre-built solution in a contained way to learn, investigate and experiment with different aspects of Google Cloud. You don't need to be an expert on GCP or Infrastructure as Code to deploy a solution, Sandbox makes solution deployment easy.
